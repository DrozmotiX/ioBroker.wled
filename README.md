**This adapter uses the service [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io) to automatically report exceptions and code errors and new device schemas to me as the developer.** More details see below!

## wled adapter for ioBroker

A fast and feature-rich implementation of an ESP8266/ESP32 webserver to control NeoPixel (WS2812B, WS2811, SK6812, APA102)LEDs or also SPI based chipsets like the WS2801!

[WLED - Github Project](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED) by @Aircoookie

## Instructions

The adapter automatically try's to find WLED devices in your network using Bonjour services.  
Known issues : Networks with VLAN seperation mostly don't route broadcast traffic, meaning autodetect will fail.  

Don't worry, in that case you can add the device manually by IP-Adress.

1) Ensure your WLED device is runnning and reachable by network
2) Install the adapter
3) Configure intervall times for data polling and auto-detect cyclus  
4 - A) Start the adapter, devices should be detected automatically  
4 - B) If A fails, use the Add-Device button an provide the device IP-Adress  
5) Adapter will send changes immediatly and polls data every x seconds (configurable)

## To-Do

* [ ] Switch polling to socket connections, pending implementation at WLED firmware

## What is Sentry.io and what is reported to the servers of that company?
Sentry.io is a service for developers to get an overview about errors from their applications. And exactly this is implemented in this adapter.

When the adapter crashes or an other Code error happens, this error message that also appears in the ioBroker log is submitted to Sentry. When you allowed iobroker GmbH to collect diagnostic data then also your installation ID (this is just a unique ID **without** any additional infos about you, email, name or such) is included. This allows Sentry to group errors and show how many unique users are affected by such an error. All of this helps me to provide error free adapters that basically never crashs.
